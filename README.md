# Global Earthquake Analyzer - Magnitudes and Errors

This application outputs data for earthquakes that have been sensed and recorded all around the globe, including magnitude, location, time, etc. The application does this by collecting data from a CSV file and making it easier for a user to read all details associated with a particular earthquake or find data based on a specific factor such as magnitude of a certain size.   

## Files
##### ```/src```: Source Scripts
- ```app.py```: this Flask application that uses CRUD operations and allows users to submit jobs to output information about the ISS 
- ```jobs.py```: this Python script creates a job from the Flask API and adds it to a HotQueue queue, and updates its status.
- ```worker.py```: this Python script reads the queue and executes a mapping and plotting analysis.
##### Container files
- ```Dockerfile.api```: creates a Docker image needed to containerize the Flask application
- ```Dockerfile.wrk```: creates a Docker image needed to containerize the worker
- ```Makefile```: automation tool that serves as a tool to clean, build, and run the containers
- ```requirements.txt```: captures the required libraries and packages for the application in Dockerfiles
##### ```/test```: Test Suite
- ```test_app.py```: Pytest suite for the Flask application routes
##### ```/kubernetes/prod```: Kubernetes yaml Files
- ```app-prod-api-deployment.yml```: pulls earthquake api container from Dockerhub and deploys it.
- ```app-prod-api-service.yml```: provides an IP for the user to curl for their routes.
- ```app-prod-db-deployment.yml```: pulls Redis image from DockerHub and deploys the database.
- ```app-prod-db-service.yml```: provides a Redis IP so that the deployments can access the dataset's database.
- ```app-prod-db-pvc.yml```: make a request for storage to the Kubernetes admin for the database.
- ```app-prod-wrk-deployment.yml```: pulls worker container from DockerHub and deploys it in two replicas so that two workers can be working on the queue concurrently.

##### CSV file to be used as data:
- ```all_month.csv```: a CSV with global earthquake data set that describes various features of the recorded earthquake

### Obtaining Dataset
The CSV file above comes from the United State government's official website found [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php).

### Get files

##### Clone the contents of this repository by entering what follows the $ into a terminal or SCP client:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/serenashah/earthquake-analyzer.git
```

(other methods for cloning a repository are described here [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

#### CSV file download
- Required data files: `all_month.csv` 
- Download the data [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php)
    - ```all_month.csv```: "All Earthquakes"

##### Download the files by entering what follows the $ into a terminal or SCP client:
```
$ https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv
```

## Build Containerized App on Local Machine

The images may built by using either the Dockerfiles or Makefile in this repository.
Replace `<username>` and `<tag>` with your own username and tag.
You may replace `<your port number>` with 5028 or another port not in use

### Using Makefile
####  Enter the following to build and run new image
```
$ make all
```
This stops, builds, and runs the API image, worker image, and Redis image.
Create a directory ```data``` with root privileges to mount the data before running this command.
Alter the ```NAME```, ```GID```, and ```UID``` at the top of the Makefile with the appropriate values for your local machine.

The containers will run in the background and you can curl routes provided by the Flask API once you have posted data to the application.

## How to Interact with the Application
This section details how to interact with the application and interpret the results.

The following is a template of how to interact with the application replacing  `<your port number>` with the port number you are using and
`<route>` with the one of the routes shown in this section.

```
$ curl localhost:<your port number>/<route>
```

#### `/help` - shows list of routes

```
$ curl localhost:<your port number>/help
```
 
Output below explains how to download the data and lists of the routes:

```
 
FIRST LOAD DATA USING THE FOLLOWING PATH: /load -X POST

    IF THERE ARE ERRORS LOAD THE DATA ONCE MORE


    Navigation:

    Use the following routes to access the data:
      1.  /epochs
          #lists all epochs
      2.  /epochs/<epoch>
          #data for specific epoch
      3.  /countries
          #lists all countries
      4.  /countries/<country>
          #data for specific country
      5.  /countries/<country>/regions
          #lists all regions
      6.  /countries/<country>/regions/<region>
          #data for specific region
      7.  /countries/<country>/regions/<region>/cities
          #lists all cities
      8. /countries/<country>/regions/<region>/cities/<cities>
          #data for specific city

```

#### `/load` - loads data from XML files

```
$ curl localhost:<your port number>/load -X POST
```
 
Output below is confirmation that the functions in app.py can now use the XML data:

```
Data has been loaded
```

The following output is an error message that appears when '-X POST' is accidentally omitted

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>405 Method Not Allowed</title>
<h1>Method Not Allowed</h1>
<p>The method is not allowed for the requested URL.</p>
````

#### `/epochs` - lists all epochs

```
$ curl localhost:<your port number>/epochs
```

#### `/epochs/<epoch>` data for specific epoch

```
$ curl localhost:<your port number>/epochs/<epoch>
```
Example:

```
$ curl localhost:5027/epochs/2022-057T11:32:56.869Z
```

Output below is the data associated with one epoch:

```
{
  "X": {
    "#text": "-4945.2048874258298",
    "@units": "km"
  },
  "X_DOT": {
    "#text": "1.19203952554952",
    "@units": "km/s"
  },
  "Y": {
    "#text": "-3625.9704508659102",
    "@units": "km"
  },
  "Y_DOT": {
    "#text": "-5.67286420497775",
